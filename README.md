I explored Dart, the programming language used in Flutter. This included understanding variables, data types, control structures like loops and conditionals, and collections like lists and maps. I also learned how to create functions and handle errors using try-catch blocks.

### Achievement
I built a console-based calculator app, applying Dart programming fundamentals to create a functional program.
